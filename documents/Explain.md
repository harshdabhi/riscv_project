Let's break down your questions about the SHA-256 benchmark results.

## Anomalies in the Performance Plot

You're observing "weird spikes" in the performance plot, particularly in the orange line ("with B extension"). There are a few likely reasons for these anomalies, especially when benchmarking cryptographic operations on real hardware:

1.  **Cache Effects:**
    *   **Cache Misses:** When the data being processed (or the code itself) doesn't fit into the CPU's cache, it has to be fetched from slower main memory. This significantly increases execution time. As the file size grows, the probability of cache misses can fluctuate, leading to these spikes.
    *   **Cache Line Conflicts:** Sometimes, different data that are accessed at different times might map to the same cache lines, causing them to evict each other unnecessarily, leading to performance degradation.
    *   **Instruction Cache:** Similar to data caches, the instruction cache can also experience misses if the code being executed is large or if other processes are using up instruction cache space.

2.  **Branch Prediction Failures:** Modern CPUs use branch prediction to guess which path of execution will be taken (e.g., in `if` statements or loops). If the prediction is wrong, the CPU has to discard the work it did based on the incorrect guess and restart from the correct path, causing a performance penalty. While SHA-256 has a very regular structure, there might be subtle factors leading to occasional mispredictions.

3.  **System Noise and Other Processes:**
    *   **Operating System Activity:** Even on a dedicated system, the operating system performs background tasks (scheduling, interrupts, system calls, etc.) that can momentarily take CPU time away from your benchmark. These can cause small, unpredictable variations.
    *   **Thermal Throttling:** If the CPU overheats, it may intentionally slow itself down to prevent damage. This would manifest as a significant performance drop. However, the spikes you're seeing are increases, so this is less likely to be the primary cause of the spikes themselves, but could contribute to overall variability.
    *   **Shared Resources:** If your system is not solely dedicated to this benchmark, other running processes or hardware (like I/O devices) could be competing for resources (CPU, memory bandwidth), leading to unpredictable performance.

4.  **Specific Instruction Latencies/Throughput:** While the RISC-V Zksh extension provides dedicated instructions, the exact timing and interaction of these instructions with other parts of the pipeline can sometimes lead to slight variations. This is especially true if the benchmark is pushing the limits of what the pipeline can handle.

5.  **The Nature of the "B Extension":**
    The `Zksh` extension you're using for SHA-256 provides specialized instructions for SHA-256 operations. These instructions are designed to be highly parallel and efficient for the SHA-256 algorithm. The spikes might be related to how these instructions are implemented in the specific RISC-V core you are using, and how they interact with the rest of the pipeline. For example, a particular instruction might have a slightly longer latency in certain contexts, or its execution might depend on the completion of a previous, less optimized instruction.

**Why the spikes are more pronounced on the "with B extension" line:**
It's possible that the accelerated instructions are more sensitive to pipeline states or cache conditions. When the "accelerated" path hits a suboptimal condition (like a cache miss), the performance penalty might be more noticeable compared to the standard C implementation, which might have been more "well-behaved" in terms of cache usage or branch prediction in those specific scenarios.

## What Files Are You Encrypting?

You are not encrypting files in this code. You are **hashing** files.

*   **Hashing (SHA-256):** This is a one-way cryptographic function. It takes an input (your file data) and produces a fixed-size output (a 256-bit hash value, often represented as 64 hexadecimal characters). The primary purposes of hashing are:
    *   **Integrity Verification:** You can hash a file, store the hash separately, and later re-hash the file. If the new hash matches the old one, you know the file hasn't been tampered with.
    *   **Password Storage:** Instead of storing passwords directly, you store their hashes.
    *   **Data Indexing/Identification:** Used in various data structures and systems to quickly identify or group data.

*   **Encryption:** This is a two-way process. It takes input data (plaintext) and uses a key to transform it into unreadable data (ciphertext). The ciphertext can be transformed back into the original plaintext using the correct key. Encryption is used to keep data secret.

The code you provided implements the SHA-256 hashing algorithm.

## Is it because you are generating files and encrypting simultaneously?

No, you are **generating files and hashing them simultaneously**, not encrypting them. The `create_test_file` function generates a sequence of bytes to be used as input for the SHA-256 hash. This is done within the `run_benchmark_for_size` function *before* the hashing begins.

The benchmarking process is structured as follows for each file size:
1.  **Create a temporary file:** A file of a specific size (`current_size`) is created and filled with predictable data (bytes `i % 256`).
2.  **Open the temporary file:** The file is opened for reading.
3.  **Initialize SHA-256 context:** `sha256_init(&ctx);`
4.  **Read and Hash:** The file is read in chunks (`file_buffer`), and each chunk is processed by `sha256_update`.
5.  **Finalize Hash:** `sha256_final(&ctx, final_hash);` calculates the final hash value.
6.  **Time Measurement:** `clock()` is used to record the start and end times of the hashing process.
7.  **Cleanup:** The temporary file is closed and removed.

The performance measurement (`execution_time`) is specifically for the SHA-256 hashing operations (`sha256_init`, `sha256_update` loop, `sha256_final`). The file creation time is *not* included in this measurement, so it wouldn't be the direct cause of spikes in the hashing performance itself.

**In summary:** The spikes are likely due to underlying hardware and system behavior related to caching, branch prediction, and resource contention, rather than a direct flaw in the generation-then-hashing process. The accelerated instructions might be more sensitive to these factors, making their performance variations more apparent.
